        <h4><b>Travel Insurance Plan</b></h4>
         <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;">Travel insurance is a type of insurance that protects you against the unknown costs of a trip. This primarily comprises risk fees and other unanticipated expenses incurred on single or numerous trips. The finest travel insurance plan protects you from having to carry it all on your own, which might be a financial strain on your trip.
       <br>
       <br>
       Travel insurance is not as crucial to many people as other types of insurance because it is only required for adventurous excursions. Other hazards, such as lost bags, lost passports, medical expenses, missed flights, personal accidents, and so on, are not taken into account.
        </p>
