        <h4><b>What is Motor Insurance?</b></h4>
        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;">According to the Motor Vehicles Act of 1988, vehicles operating on Indian
            highways must be insured. Automobile, two-wheeler, and commercial vehicle insurance are all available. Motor
            insurance covers physical damage, natural disasters, and any losses incurred by the insured in the event of
            an unforeseeable catastrophe.
        </p>
        <p style="color: grey;">In India, there are several different types of car insurance:</p>

        <ul class="text-secondary">
            <li>Private Car Insurance Policy</li>
            <li>Two-Wheeler Insurance Policy</li>
            <li>Commercial Vehicle Insurance</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Private Car Insurance Policy: </b>If this person has a car insurance
            policy, it covers the costs of accidents, fires, theft, self-ignition, and other events, as well as injuries
            and third-party liability..</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Two-Wheeler Insurance Policy: </b>According to the governing statute of
            1988, insurance plans for two-wheelers such as a scooter or a bike are also required. Accidents, fire,
            theft, natural calamities, personal accidents, and third-party liabilities are all covered under this
            policy.</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Commercial Vehicle Insurance </b>This insurance covers commercial
            vehicles such as trucks, buses, large commercial vehicles, light commercial vehicles, agricultural vehicles,
            taxis, cabs, ambulances, and auto rickshaws.</p>



        <h4><b>In India, there are several different types of motor insurance policies:</b></h4>
        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"> - Coverage for third-party liability and
        </p>
        <p class="text-secondary">- Comprehensive motor insurance policy</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">Third-party liability insurance protects you if your car is involved in an accident
            that causes damage or loss to a third party. The company's automobile insurance policy protects you.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">Comprehensive motor insurance policy: Under this insurance, damage and loss caused to
            the third party and your vehicle are both covered.</p>




        <h4><b> Features of motor insurance </b></h4>
        <ul class="text-secondary">
            <li> Loss or damage to the insured vehicle</li>
            <li>Personal accident insurance</li>
            <li>A large garage network</li>
            <li>Third-party liabilities</li>
            <li>Bonus for no claims</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Damage to or loss to the insured vehicle</b>The insurance company will
            cover any damage to the insured vehicle caused by an accident, fire, spontaneous combustion, or a loss
            caused by theft, strikes, or terrorism. The extra benefit is that it also covers loss due to transit damage
            or loss.</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Personal accident cover: </b>Personal accidents are covered for a
            predetermined amount under motor insurance, as well as permanent disability caused by an accident.</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>A large garage network: </b>Some insurance firms also have garage
            networks where they supply repair services if they are needed, making it more convenient for policyholders.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Third-party Liabilities: </b>If your car is involved in a collision with
            a third party, your insurer will pay for the damage done to that person. Your insurance also aids legal
            accountability in cases of significant injury or death.</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Bonus for no claims: </b>If no claims are filed during the policy's
            term, the firm will give you a discount on the following year's premium, making the insurance even more
            reasonable.</p>
