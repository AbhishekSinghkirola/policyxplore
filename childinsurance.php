        <h4><b>Child Insurance Plan</b></h4>
        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;">A child plan is an investment you make to ensure the future of your child.
            Your major goal as a parent is to be able to provide till your child completes their education and is
            financially stable.
        </p>
        <p style="color: grey;">With a child insurance plan, you're not only providing safety, but you're
            also investing. You will get a lump sum payment at the end of the policy's term. In addition, these plans
            offer a customizable payout at a significant milestone. This covers your child's expenses, such as college
            tuition or a wedding. Even if you are not present, your child's future is secure.
        </p>


        <h4><b>How does child insurance secure your childâ€™s future?</b></h4>
        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;">- Provides people with financial security, even if they are unable to work.
        </p>
        <p class="text-secondary">- A single plan that includes both insurance and investment advantages.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">- Ensure a child's future even if parents are not present.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">- Create habits that urge you to save regularly.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">- As needed, the plan allows for partial or flexible payouts.</p>
        <p class="text-secondary">- Premiums paid can be claimed as a tax deductible</p>



        <h4><b>What kinds of children's plans can I opt from?</b></h4>
        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;">Generally speaking, there are two broad categories:</p>
        <ul class="text-secondary">
            <li>Traditional child plan</li>
            <li>Unit link child plan</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Traditional plans combine the advantages of saving with
                insurance.</b>You get the lump sum amount plus the bonus that has accrued due to saving when you reach
            maturity. The money is given to the beneficiary in the event of a premature death, which in the case of a
            child plan is a kid.</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Unit link child plan:</b>This plan has both investing and insurance
            features. Your premium is split into two parts: one is invested in market-linked items, and the other is
            used to protect your child's future. The ULIP plan provides you with transparency and flexibility when it
            comes to the investment you're holding. At maturity, you will get a fund value equal to the amount you
            invested. In the event of the unexpected death of a parent, the ULIP pays the nominee a sum promised or the
            fund value (whichever is higher).</p>
