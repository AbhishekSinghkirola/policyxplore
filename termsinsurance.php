        <h4><b>Term insurance</b></h4>
        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;">Term life insurance is a sort of life insurance that is only valid for a
            certain amount of time. It protects a beneficiary financially in the event of the death of a person insured
            within the policy's term.
        </p>
        <p style="color: grey;">In most cases, the benefit amount is paid to the nominee in the event of an insured
            death with term insurance.</p>

        <h4><b>What is the purpose of term insurance?</b></h4>

        <ul class="text-secondary">
            <li>The financial stability of the family</li>
            <li>Asset protection</li>
            <li>Critical illness benefits</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Financial stability of the family: </b>If the policyholder is the
            family's sole source of income, purchasing a term plan will ensure the family's financial security.</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Assets Protection: </b>If you have accepted a loan in your presence, it
            might be a personal loan, a home loan, a vehicle loan, or something else entirely. Debt repayment can be a
            financial strain on your family.</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Critical sickness coverage: </b>Critical illness coverage is available
            in some term policies. This provides financial protection against life-threatening diseases such as cancer
            and heart attack, which grow over time as people get older.</p>



        <h4><b>Term Insurance's Advantages</b></h4>
        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Affordable premium: </b>You can receive high-value life insurance by
            paying a low monthly, half-yearly, or annual premium. The cheaper the premium, the earlier you purchase a
            term plan.</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Whole life cover: </b>Term insurance covers you for a longer period of
            time than whole life insurance, which covers you for 99 years.</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Critical illness benefit: </b>If you have a critical illness benefit in
            your term plan, you will receive a lump sum payment if you are diagnosed with it.</p>



        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Payment of the sum insured: </b>In the event of a policyholder's death,
            the sum assured will be paid to the beneficiary. It can come in the form of a lump sum, a monthly income, or
            an annual payment, according to the policyholder's preferences. This will assist the family in meeting its
            financial obligations.</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Accidental death benefit: </b>An accidental death benefit can be added
            to your term plan to give financial protection in the case of an accident.</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Terminal sickness coverage: </b>The term plan covers terminal illnesses
            such as AIDS with a lump sum payment.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b>Tax benefit: </b>You can gain a tax break on premiums paid under Section
            80C, and the lump sum received by the nominee as a death benefit is tax-free under Section 80C.</p>
