               <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b class="text-dark">Term insurance: </b>Term insurance is a type of insurance that has a set term/period for which it offers coverage. The beneficiary receives financial protection in exchange for the premium paid. It provides life insurance at a low cost.
</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b class="text-dark">Retirement plans: </b>Retirement insurance protects a person's financial situation after they retire. It allows retired people to be financially independent. They'll be able to live on their terms and won't be a burden to anyone.</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b class="text-dark">Investment plan: </b>An investment plan allows us to maximize our savings by investing in market products. Our savings grow in tandem with the market as we invest in money market goods.
</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b class="text-dark">Child Plan: </b>A child insurance plan can help secure a child's future even after their parents pass away. In this case, insurance companies cover the costs of a child's schooling, marriage, and other expenses.
</p>

        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b class="text-dark">ULIPs (Unit linked insurance plans):</b>ULIPs are insurance and investment products in one. The premium is split into two halves, one for financial protection and the other to boost our savings.
</p>
        <p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b class="text-dark">Whole life insurance: </b>As the name implies, whole life insurance covers the policyholder's entire life as long as the payment is paid on time.
</p>
<p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b class="text-dark">Group Life Insurance: </b>Group life insurance is a type of policy that covers a group of people under one policy. Employees of a corporation, a housing association, and so on can be included in these categories.

</p>
<p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b class="text-dark">Money-back policy: </b>This policy allows policyholders to receive periodic payments in the form of recurring returns or a lump sum.
</p>
<p class="mt-4" style="color: grey;"><b class="text-dark">Term insurance with return of premium: </b>Term insurance with return of premium is similar to term insurance, but the main distinction is that in term insurance with return of premium, the insured can receive a refund of the premium paid (minus taxes) from the insurance provider.
